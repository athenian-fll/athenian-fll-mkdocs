# Makecode Projects

## Loading Projects

You have to connect a serial cable to the EV3 brick to load new projects. Bluetooth and Wifi connections
will not work.

## User History

There is no login screen. Your project history is stored on a browser-specific basis. Thus, if you 
switch from Safari to Chrome, you will not see the projects, previously created in Safari, on Chrome.

## Editing Projects
* Once you publish a project, the project associated with that URL is read-only. If you 
want to edit a previously-saved project, you have to publish it again to a new URL.
* Project names are not unique.
* You can delete a project by opening it, clicking on the Gear icon, and then selecting ``Delete Project``.

## Sharing Projects

To share a project with another person via a URL:
 
1. Click on ``share`` and then ``Publish project``.
2. Copy the project URL and email it to another user.
3. The other user can then either open the URL in a new browser window, or
go to the [Makecode Mindstorms](https://makecode.mindstorms.com) page click on ``Impor`` and import the URL.
4. Changes to the new project will not be reflected in the original project. To save changes, publish it 
as a new project.

To share a project with another person via a ```.uf2``` file:

1. Download the project ```.uf2``` file
2. Go to the [Makecode Mindstorms](https://makecode.mindstorms.com) page, click on ``Import`` and import the ```.uf2``` file.

To publish your project on a webpage for others to use:

1. Click on ``share`` and then ``Publish project``.
2. Expand on ``Embed``.
3. Click on ``Editor``.
4. Copy and paste the HTML to a webpage.
