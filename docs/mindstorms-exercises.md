### Crazy Eyes 

1) Display Crazy 1 and Crazy 2 eyes images (or any two opposing images).

2) Add pauses after each image block to prevent the images from flashing on the display.

3) Create a sequence of alternating eyes. After 4 or 5 images, the student should realize the need for a loop.

4) Add an infinite loop to create animation.

5) Play with different pause lengths: 3, 1, .5, .25, .10.

6) Adjust the loop to terminate after 5 iterations.

7) Adjust the loop to terminate after 10 seconds. Notice that the timing might not be exact if 
lang pause blocks are included.

8) Adjust the loop to terminate when the ``center button`` is pressed.
Notice a button press will *not* be recognized during execution of 
the blocks in the loop. Long pause values will possibly require longer button presses.

9) Adjust the loop to terminate when a touch sensor is pressed.


### Touchy Dog

1) Make the EV3 bark `until` the ``center button`` is pressed.

2) Make the EV3 bark `when` the ``center button`` is pressed.

3) Make the LED turn green if pressed and red if not.

4) Play a meow when the ``up button`` is pressed.

5) Play a elephant sound when the ``down button`` is pressed.

6) Make it bark twice when a touch sensor is pressed.


### Square Dance

1) Go forward 1 foot, stop, turn 90 degrees and continue the outline of a square.

2) Convert this to using a loop and get rid of 3/4 of the blocks used in step 1.

3) Copy and paste the loop and make the EV3 do a square forward and then in reverse.


### Non-linear Car Path

1) Make the EV3 travel on a sinusoidal path to a target (smooth turning only, no angles allowed).

2) Make the EV3 travel on a saw-tooth path to a target (only 45 degree angles are allowed).

3) Make the EV3 travel on a rectilinear path to a target (only 90 degree turns are allowed).


## Challenges

### Forward and Back

1) Go forward 2 feet and then go back 2 feet using time.

2) Do the same thing, but use motor rotations.

3) Go forward until hitting a wall and then go into reverse for 2 feet.

3) Go forward 2 fee using rotationst, stop, turn 180 degrees and then drive back to starting position.

4) Go forward until a color sensor sees a black line and then turn around and come back to starting position.


### Line following

1) One sensor

2) Two sensor
